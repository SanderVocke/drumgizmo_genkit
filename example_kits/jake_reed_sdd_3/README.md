# Jake Reed Super Dead Drums Vol 3 kit

You are going to need to add the sample pack yourself for this kit to work.

Generated with:

```
python ./drumgizmo_genkit.py -c configs/jake_reed_sdd_3.py -r "/mnt/data/vst_sound_data/DrumGizmo/Jake_Reed_Super_Dead_Drums/JAKE REED SUPER DEAD DRUMS VOL 3/SDD VOL 3 ONE SHOTS" -a -o /mnt/data/vst_sound_data/DrumGizmo/Jake_Reed_Super_Dead_Drums/kits/vol_3
```

Note the relative paths here, putting the XMLs outside a collection folder with multiple Jake Reed packs - if you want to put it elsewhere with relation to the sample pack, you may need to modify the amount of "../../" leading each path in each instrument XML.

## MIDI map

Thrown together by starting with some basic Roland mappings, then adding left-over instruments to arbitrary notes. Room for improvement.

## Other notes

* No Hi-hat open/close support yet for an E-kit.
